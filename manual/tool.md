## Build and Run

- The `revel` command line tool is required to use the Revel framework
- The code/app is in a seperate repository [github.com/revel/cmd](https://github.com/revel/cmd)
- It is NOT included with the main framework
- To install, run the command below

{% highlight sh %}
	$ go get -u github.com/revel/cmd/revel
{% endhighlight  %}

<div class="alert alert-danger">Gotcha: The command is in the subdirectory '/revel' ie <code>revel/cmd/revel</code> and not <code>revel/cmd</code></div>

Now run it:

	$ bin/revel
	~
	~ revel! http://revel.github.io
	~
	usage: revel command [arguments]

	The commands are:

		new         create a skeleton Revel application
		run         run a Revel application
		build       build a Revel application (e.g. for deployment)
		package     package a Revel application (e.g. for deployment)
		clean       clean a Revel application's temp files
		test        run all tests from the command-line
		version     displays the Revel Framework and Go version

	Use "revel help [command]" for more information.
